# ThirdPersonTemplate for Daz3d assets
This is the Third Person Template for Daz3d assets. The goal of this project is to give examples of how to use the Daz3d with Unreal Engine 4 and also create a boilerplate to make this process more straightforward to users. 
This project comes with content from the Genesis 8 Essentials and Epicâ€™s Content Example Project. 
It also comes with a Digital Human based shader for skin and hair, a FK Control Rig solution for gameplay and a Control Rig setup for G8M/G8,1M and G8F/G8.1F figures.
