This is the Third Person Template for Daz3d assets. The goal of this project is to give examples of how to use the Daz3d assets with Unreal Engine 4 and also create a boilerplate to make this process more straightforward to users. 

This project comes with content from the Genesis 8 Essentials and Epicâ€™s Content Example Project. 

It also comes with a Digital Human inspired shader for skin and hair, a FK Control Rig solution for gameplay and a Control Rig setup for G8M/G8.1M and G8F/G8.1F figures. 

IMPORTANT: to use the FK and Control Rig with new figures, you need to enable fix bone rotations on import: http://davidvodhanel.com/daz-to-unreal-fix-bone-rotations-option/
