This is a forever free Third Person Template for Daz3d assets. The goal of this project is not to create a full game, but to showcase how to use Daz3d assets with unreal and offer some basic features for a quick start. 

This project comes with content from the Genesis 8 Essentials and Epicâ€™s Content Example Project.

# Future Goals:

Improve the control-rig setup

Improve the inventory system

Create a system that allows the use of Daz morphs to customize the character in-game

Create a Hand Ik Solution.

Create a ragdoll physics for the genesis 8 mesh.

Create a Save system

Add a simple example on how to blend combat animations with the locomotion system

Create masks for makeup and brows to fill the slots available at the skin shader. For now, there are masks only for the lips and nails. I recommend the use of the skin builder product to fill those slots while there is no free texture available.

Make the actor components blueprints more modular and plug and play.

Create documentation to help people migrate the functionalities of this project to their own projects.
